Hello

Me and @Jonas are evaluating our master thesis project on procedural content generation, and we need your help. 
The evaluation tests your ability to navigate different maps we have made. 
The evaluation is done at info.omk.dk and takes around 5-10 minutes. 
All information about the evaluation will be available at the site.
The evaluation needs to be done at a computer and does not work in the Safari browser. 

Thanks a lot for helping us.
