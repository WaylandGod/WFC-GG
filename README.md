# WFC-GG
Wave Function Collapse and Growing Neural Grids combined!





#### Instructions
There are three different modulesets included.
- 3dModuleSet. This set contains a city moduleset made for three dimmensions. The bool "Corner Setup Clockwise" should be false when using this set.

- HandDrawnset. This is a two dimmensional set of a handrawn city. The Grid Y should be set to 1 and the "Corner Setup Clockwise" should be true.

- modules. This is the original set and is a 2.5 dimmensional cavern set. The Grid Y should be set to 1 and the "Corner Setup Clockwise" should be true.
